In April 2019 **Daniel Wainwright** [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-47947867) on the lack of diversity in councils with almost 1,000 2019 local election candidates named either David or Dave, compared with 151 called Sue, the most popular female name, while councils were criticised for being "too slow" to encourage women and people from BAME communities to stand.
